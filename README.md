# üë©üèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è MedicalPage - LABMedical

<p>This project is based on a challenge from Dev. FullStack module 2 that taught how to use React, HTML, and CSS to create a page.In this case, the project was based on a page for doctors to organize themselves in relation to patient appointments and exams.</p>
<br>
<p>Thus, this programming solves the problem of user(doctor) data which can help in communication between the doctor/patient, knowing the main information of the patients, how many consultations and exams he/she has already performed/will perform.</p>

## üíØ Improvements

<p>Acredito que para melhorar o meu proejto eu teria que ter tipo mais tempo e aprofundamento no localStorage. Al√©m disso, acredito que sempre h√° como melhorar a cara da p√°gina, eu gostaria que a minha p√°gina estuvesse com um visual mais bonito.</p>

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Gratitudes

<p>In this project in particular I would like to thank Professor Robert for believing that I could finish the project on time and having answered all my questions whenever he was available. And just as it was said in the first project: I would like to thank initially the FloripaMaisTec program for the opportunity to study something that I want to take for my professional life forever for free. I would also like to thank SENAI and LAB365 for offering a course so rich in knowledge for people with a thirst for learning. Finally, I would like to thank mainly the teachers for all their patience, willingness to teach and time dedicated to the students and the course.</p>
